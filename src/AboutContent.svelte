<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<details>
    <summary>Is it possible to exclude some fighters / boards from the random selection ?</summary>
    Yes, if you click on the "filter" button you can exclude characters / boards you don't own or don't want to play. They will also be excluded from the random selection.

<details>
    <summary>How is the "advantage" calculated ?</summary>
    The data comes from <a href="https://www.umleague.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UM league</a>, a community for Unmatched stats and tournaments. A win / lose rate between 45% and 55% is considered as "no advantage". A rate between 40% and 45% or between 55% and 60% is a "small advantage" (▶). Anything below 40% or above 60% is a "big advantage" (▶▶). Matchups with less than 10 recorded results are considered statistically insignificant and ignored. Make sure to consult the UM league website for details.

    <summary>Can I use this to pair 4 players ?</summary>
    Not at the moment, but it's something I will probably look into soon. In the meantime, you can always do the pairing twice.
